The parameters that can be set are: maximum number of iterations, mutation rate, population size, child populaltion size, number of runs, number of iterations with no changes after which the algorithms is considered to have converged, floating point precision for coding. The results in five runs with the parameters maximum number of iterations = 500, mutation rate = 20%, convergence number = 100, precistion = 3 are:

1) population size = 20
